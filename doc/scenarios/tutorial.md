# How to Write a Scenario

**Scenarios** describe how you want MZBench to behave during the benchmark. If you're testing an online store, your scenario will probably include opening a product page and adding the product to cart. For a search service, the scenario may be searching for a random word. You get the idea.

Here's how you write a scenario to load-test a locally running web app.

1.  Create a file called *myscenario.erl* with this content:

        [ {pool,
            [
                {size, 1},
                {worker_type, http_worker}
            ],
            [
                {set_host, "localhost"},
                {set_port, 8080},
                {get, "/"}
            ]
        }].

    Scenarios are written in [special language](spec.md) similar to Erlang. Here's what this scenatio means, step by step:

        [ {pool,
            [
                {size, 1},
                {worker_type, http_worker}
            ],

    Here we define a [pool](spec.md#pools) of workers, namely one worker of type `http_worker`. Workers of this type can send GET and POST HTTP requests, which is exactly what we need.

            [
                {set_host, "localhost"},
                {set_port, 8080},
                {get, "/"}
            ]
        }].

    Here we define the actions that each worker in the pool must perform: set the target host and port and send a single GET request to the "/" endpoint, i.e. to *http://localhost:8080/*.

2.  Launch the MZBench server and start your scenario:

        $ ./bin/mzbench start_server
        Executing make -C /path/to//mzbench/bin/../server generate
        Executing /path/to//mzbench/bin/../server/_build/default/rel/mzbench_api/bin/mzbench_api start
        
        $ ./bin/mzbench start /path/to/myscenarion.erl
        {
            "status": "pending", 
            "id": 107
        }
        
3.  Go to [localhost:4800](http://localhost:4800) and see your benchmark run and complete:

    ![Single Request](images/single_request.png)

    Great, it works! But one request isn't going to load your web app too much, is it? Let's extend our scenario to generate some proper load.
    
4.  Modify *myscenario.erl* so that it looks like this:

        [ {pool,
            [
                {size, 1},
                {worker_type, http_worker}
            ],
            [
                {set_host, "localhost"},
                {set_port, 8080},
                {loop,
                    [
                        {time, {1, min}},
                        {rate, {10, rps}}
                    ],
                    [
                        {get, "/"}
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }].
        
    We've replaced a single GET request with a [loop](spec.md#loops) that sends 10 requests per second for 1 minute.
    
5.  Start the modified scenario:

        $ ./bin/mzbench start /path/to/myscenario.erl
        {
            "status": "pending", 
            "id": 109
        }
        
    Go to [localhost:4800](http://localhost:4800) to see a graph updated in real time as your benchmark is running:
    
    ![50 RPS](images/50rps.png)
